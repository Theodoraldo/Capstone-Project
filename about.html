      The main goal of this forum is to eradicate cholera by the end of 2025.
      Cholera is an easily treatable disease. The majority of people can be
      treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration
      solution (ORS).

      Although signs and symptoms of severe cholera can be unmistakable in areas
      where it's common, the only way to confirm a diagnosis is to identify the
      bacteria in a stool sample. Rapid cholera dipstick tests enable doctors in
      remote areas to quickly confirm a cholera diagnosis. Quick confirmation
      helps to decrease death rates at the start of cholera outbreaks and leads
      to earlier public health interventions for outbreak control.
